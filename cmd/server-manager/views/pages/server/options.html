        You can use the button below to rebuild the Search Index. You shouldn't need to do this often - if at all - but
        if you have manually added content to your content folder (i.e. not uploaded the content through Server Manager),
        you will need to use this so that the content shows up in the Search. Note that this process can take a long time.
