Right! With that let's begin setting up the server.

Installation Steps:
-------------------

1. Unzip the server-manager.zip to your preferred location.
2. Open the config.yml file in your favourite editor. This is important, some things do need configuring here.
3. Read the config.yml file carefully. The most important part of this is the 'steam' section. At the very minimum,
   you must change the 'install_path' setting. You should make this point to your Assetto Corsa Server install.

   On Windows, this will most likely look something like this:

   C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\assettocorsa\server

   But it will vary a bit depending on your Windows installation, so please find your correct path and put it in the
   config file.

   After configuring this, feel free to read the rest of the configuration file and change things as you see fit. We've
   tried our best to make the defaults be as sensible as possible, but you can tune things to your liking here.

4. Run the 'server-manager' executable. On Windows, this will open your browser window. If you're on Linux, you'll
   need to manually open the URL: http://localhost:8772 in your browser.

5. Log in to Server Manager. You can do this with the "Login" link underneath the Person icon in the navigation. You'll
   need the default username and password to get in, they are:

       username: admin
       password: servermanager

   When you log in, you will be immediately prompted to change your password. You can add new accounts at any time from
   the server manager web interface.


Forgotten Password:
-------------------

If you've forgotten your password, you can set a password_override key in the config.yml. It will change the admin
password to be whatever you have specified in plain text. You will then be prompted to change your password on next
login.

The default admin user cannot be deleted or have its group changed.
