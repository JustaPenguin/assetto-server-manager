## Installation


### Manual

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cj123/assetto-server-manager/releases)
2. Extract the release
3. Edit the config.yml to suit your preferences
4. Either:
   - Copy the server folder from your Assetto Corsa install into the directory you configured in config.yml, or
   - Make sure that you have [steamcmd](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) installed and in your $PATH 
     and have configured the steam username and password in the config.yml file.
5. Start the server using `./server-manager` (on Linux) or by running `server-manager.exe` (on Windows)


### Docker

A docker image is available under the name `seejy/assetto-server-manager`. We recommend using docker-compose
to set up a docker environment for the server manager. Note that this docker image **does not** have steamcmd pre-installed.

See [Manual](#Manual) to set up server manager without Docker.

**Note**: if you are using a directory volume for the server install (as is shown below), be sure to make 
the directory before running `docker-compose up` - otherwise its permissions may be incorrect. 

You will need a [config.yml](https://github.com/cj123/assetto-server-manager/blob/master/cmd/server-manager/config.example.yml) file to mount into the docker container.

An example docker-compose.yml looks like this:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  server-manager:
    image: seejy/assetto-server-manager:latest
    ports:
    # the port that the server manager runs on
    - "8772:8772"
    # the port that the assetto server runs on (may vary depending on your configuration inside server manager)
    - "9600:9600"
    - "9600:9600/udp"
    # the port that the assetto server HTTP API runs on.
    - "8081:8081"
    # you may also wish to bind your configured UDP plugin ports here. 
    volumes: 
    # volume mount the entire server install so that 
    # content etc persists across restarts
    - ./server-install:/home/assetto/server-manager/assetto
    
    # volume mount the config
    - ./config.yml:/home/assetto/server-manager/config.yml
```

### Post Installation

We recommend uploading your entire Assetto Corsa `content/tracks` folder to get the full features of Server Manager. 
This includes things like track images, all the correct layouts and any mod tracks you may have installed.

Also, we recommend installing Sol locally and uploading your Sol weather files to Server Manager as well so you can try out Day/Night cycles and cool weather!

### Updating

Follow the steps below to update Server Manager:

1. Back up your current Server Manager database and config.yml.
2. Download the [latest version of Server Manager](https://github.com/cj123/assetto-server-manager/releases)
3. Extract the zip file.
4. Open the Changelog, read the entries between your current version and the new version. 
   There may be configuration changes that you need to make!
5. Make any necessary configuration changes.
6. Find the Server Manager executable for your operating system. Replace your current Server Manager
   executable with it.
7. Start the new Server Manager executable.

## Build From Source Process
_This is written with Linux in mind. Note that for other platforms this general flow should work, but specific commands may differ._

1. Install Go 1.12; follow https://golang.org/doc/install#install
2. Install Node js 11; this varies a lot based on os/distribution, Google is your friend.
3. Enter the following commands in your terminal:

    ```
     # clone the repository (and dependencies) to your $GOPATH
     go get -u github.com/cj123/assetto-server-manager/...
     # move to the repository root
     cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cj123/assetto-server-manager
    ```

4. Set up the config.yml file in assetto-server-manager/cmd/server-manager (best to copy config.example.yml 
to config.yml then edit). There are important settings in here that *need* to be configured before sever manager
will run, such as the path to steamcmd, default account information and more. **Make sure you read it carefully!**
5. Time to run the manager, enter the following in your terminal:

    ``` 
     export GO111MODULE=on
     # run makefile commands to build and run server manager
     make clean
     make assets
     make assets-embed
     make run
    ```
6. Server Manager should now be running! You can find the UI in your browser at your 
configured hostname (default 0.0.0.0:8772).
