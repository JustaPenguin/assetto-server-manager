# The below file is in YAML configuration format. Spacing is important within

  # server manager uses this information ONLY to install the
  # assetto corsa server.

  # however, if you do not wish to provide server manager with this information,
  # leave it blank and install assetto corsa server to the path you specified in
  # install_path (default: 'assetto')

#  monitoring - enabling monitoring allows us to find out more information
#  about how you're using Server Manager, as well as seeing any issues that may
#  occur so we can collect and fix them. We understand that you may not wish
#  for us to do any monitoring, so you can disable it by setting 'enabled'
#  to false
#
################################################################################
#  with monitoring enabled, the following systems are in place:
#
#  1. Sentry (https://sentry.io) monitoring of both Server Manager's backend
#     code and frontend javascript. This lets us see application errors when
#     they occur.
#
#  2. Google Analytics (https://analytics.google.com) tracking so we can see how
#     many people use Server Manager, when they use it and where they are in
#     the world.
#
#  3. Prometheus Monitoring - this provides more technical debugging in terms of
#     memory and CPU usage, etc. This is *NOT* sent to us. We have added this in
#     so that anybody who wants to monitor Server Manager for themselves can do
#     so with Prometheus. We use it internally at assettocorsaservers.com to
#     track our Server installs to help us improve our service.
#
#     you can access the prometheus endpoint at:
#                <your servermanager domain>/metrics
#
#
# once again, if you do not wish for Server Manager to do these things, simply
# set 'enabled' to false and monitoring will not take place.

#  data storage - where server manager keeps your data!
#
################################################################################
store:
  # store type: this can be one of:
  #  - 'json'   - saves each custom race, championship as separate JSON files
  #               in the directory specified by store_path
  #  - 'boltdb' - saves all content inside a single database file specified by
  #               store_path
  #
  # boltdb is recommended for most users.
  type: boltdb

  # where to save the server manager data
  path: server_manager.db

  # shared data path: Set the same directory for multiple AC Server Manager
  # instances to share championship, entrants and custom events across them.
  # Leave blank to use the same path as the one set up here.
  # works only with JSON database

#  user management - this is now mostly done via the web interface.
#
################################################################################
accounts:
  # admin password override is used to override the admin password in the case
  # that you have forgotten it. set it to e.g. 'password' and log in with:
  # username: admin
  # password: password
  # and you will be prompted to change your admin password back to something you
  # can remember
  # 
  # If you are logging in for the first time, do not use this override system.
  # Instead, log in by using these credentials:
  # username: admin
  # password: servermanager
  # As soon as you log in, you will be immediately asked to set a new password.

#  live map config
#
################################################################################
live_map:
  # how often to refresh the map data in milliseconds. This value can't be below
  # 200. If you find that championship events do not finish properly, try
  # changing this to a higher number.
  # set this to 0 to disable live map.
  refresh_interval_ms: 500

#
#  server config - configure plugins, e.g. stracker here.
#
################################################################################
server:
  # audit logging logs the actions of registered users locally on your server.
  # Only Admins can access the logs, they are intended for tracking if users
  # have deleted content, started/stopped events when they shouldn't have etc.
  audit_logging: true
  # list of commands to run on server start and kill on server stop. this should
  # contain the full command with arguments to run the given program.
  #
  # you can use additional plugins with AC Server Manager, but while configuring
  # them you have to ignore the ports that AC Server Manager writes in the 
  # server_cfg.ini, as the Server Manager provides an interface to the plugins
  # instead. The plugin ports in the Server Options page are the ones that must
  # be used for the plugin configuration. Here are examples for configuring
  # sTracker and KMR plugins:
  #
  # sTracker:
  # - rcvPort must equal the port from the UDP Plugin Address
  # - sendPort must equal the value of the UDP Plugin Local Port
  #
  # KMR: 
  # - ac_server_http_port must equal the value of HTTP Port
  # - ac_server_plugin_local_port must equal the value of UDP Plugin Local Port
  # - ac_server_plugin_address_port must equal the port from the UDP Plugin Address
  # - web_auth_server_port must equal the port specified in UDP Auth Plugin Address
  # - UDP Auth Plugin Address has to be configured in the way specified by KMR documentation
  #
  # Note that AC Server Manager provides an interface for a single plugin only, 
  # as the AC gameserver does. If you want to chain multiple plugins, please 
  # follow the documentation of the plugins you're using. Plugins usually 
  # feature interfaces so additional plugins can be chained between themselves.
  #
  # you can of course add your own commands (whatever you like!) here.
  # 
  # this assumes that you have installed stracker into a folder called "stracker"
  # next to the server-manager executable.
  #
  # each executable specified is run from the directory it is inside, for example,
  # the command:
  #
  # ./stracker/stracker_linux_x86/stracker --stracker_ini stracker-default.ini
  # now actually performs the following two commands:
  #
  # 1. cd ./stracker/stracker_linux_x86
  # 2. ./stracker --stracker_ini stracker-default.ini
  run_on_start:
    # uncomment the line below for stracker on Linux
    # - ./stracker/stracker_linux_x86/stracker --stracker_ini stracker.ini

    # uncomment the line below for stracker on Windows
    # - ./stracker/stracker.exe --stracker_ini stracker.ini
