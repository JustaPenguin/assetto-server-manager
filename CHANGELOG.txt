v1.0.3
------

* Added a Live Map. You'll need to re-upload your tracks to see the live map, since it requires new
  track assets.
* Added support for plugins such as KissMyRank. Follow the KissMyRank setup, but instead of editing
  server_cfg.ini, edit the Options in Server Manager (it overwrites server_cfg.ini!)
* Overhauled UDP proxying to work with sending messages as well as existing support for receiving.
  (This is what makes KissMyRank etc work!)
* Added support for 'Reverse Grid Positions' races within Championship events.


v1.0.2
------

* Increase number of results per result listing page to 20.
* Add a 404 error for results pages that don't exist
* Results listing page now only shows a maximum of 3 pages either side of the current page you are on.


v1.0.1
------

* Fixed an issue with populating default points when creating championship classes. Points for places beyond the F1
  defaults now show '0' when created, rather than '25' which was incorrectly shown before.
* Average Lap Time on Results pages is now calculated lap times that meet the following conditions:
    "if lap doesnt cut and if lap is < 107% of average for that driver so far and if lap isn't lap 1"
* Fixed an issue with Quick Race Time/Laps selector not defaulting to the correct value.

v1.0.0
------

Initial Release!
