v1.1.2
------

* Championships are now split into active and completed championships. They are ordered by the time they were last
  updated

v1.1.1
------

* Fixed a bug that caused some scheduled races to not start correctly.

v1.1.0
------

We recommend re-uploading all of your tracks after doing this update! Some new features will only work with
new track assets!

Please also consult the config.yml in the zip file, there is a new section: "live_map" that you must add to your
config.yml to get live map functionality!

* Added a Live Map. You'll need to re-upload your tracks to see the live map, since it requires new
  track assets.
* Added support for 'Reverse Grid Positions' races within Championship events. If a second race occurs, the championship
  page will show results for that too. It will correctly add points to the entrants and optionally can apply a
  multiplier to all second races to scale their points. This multiplier can be a decimal, and can even be negative!
* Added the ability to schedule championship events and custom races.
* Added button on results page to open the results on the SimResults website.
* When creating a race the number of available pit boxes for a track/layout is now displayed, max clients is limited to
  this number (requires manual upload of track - including default content).
* Championship events now welcome each player with a message describing their current position in the championship
  and who their nearest rivals are.
* Improve handling of tracks which have a default layout (i.e. data folder in the base of the track directory) AND extra
  layouts. This fix adds compatibility for mods such as the Assetto Corsa Wet Mod.
* Added support for plugins such as KissMyRank. Follow the KissMyRank setup, but instead of editing
  server_cfg.ini, edit the Options in Server Manager (it overwrites server_cfg.ini!)
* Overhauled UDP proxying to work with sending messages as well as existing support for receiving.
  (This is what makes KissMyRank etc work!)

v1.0.2
------

* Increase number of results per result listing page to 20.
* Add a 404 error for results pages that don't exist
* Results listing page now shows 10 pages in the pagination bar with options to skip to the front and end,
  and forwards/backwards by 10 pages
* Fixed an issue with named Custom Race entrants losing their car/skin on race start
* Collision speeds on Live Timings page are now rounded to 2 decimal places

v1.0.1
------

* Fixed an issue with populating default points when creating championship classes. Points for places beyond the F1
  defaults now show '0' when created, rather than '25' which was incorrectly shown before.
* Average Lap Time on Results pages is now calculated lap times that meet the following conditions:
    "if lap doesnt cut and if lap is < 107% of average for that driver so far and if lap isn't lap 1"
* Fixed an issue with Quick Race Time/Laps selector not defaulting to the correct value.

v1.0.0
------

Initial Release!
