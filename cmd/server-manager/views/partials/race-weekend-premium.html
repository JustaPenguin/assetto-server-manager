                    Race Weekends are a premium feature. You can create and set up Race Weekends in the non-premium version of Server Manager,
                    but you can only start them if you have the premium version of Server Manager.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We hope that you are as excited about Race Weekends as we are, and that you will consider supporting us (and unlocking Race Weekends!)
                    by purchasing a premium version of Server Manager. You can do that in one of two ways:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rent a Server</strong> - always-online server hosting for Assetto Corsa - with Server Manager Premium (obviously!).
                        We handle setup and updates so you can get on and race!
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Go Premium</strong> - purchase Server Manager Premium with PayPal. This is a one-off purchase. If you send $10 or more, we will email you a copy of Server Manager Premium,
                        and all updates we make to Server Manager in the future (including Race Weekends and any new Premium features).
                    </li>
                </ul>
